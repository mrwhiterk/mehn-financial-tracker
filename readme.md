# Finance Tracker

My second project at General Assembly building a personal finance tracking app with MEHN stack.

## Deployed Site:

# How to

Sign-up for the service. Then you can immediately start adding accounts and transactions. The application will calculate running balance as you enter transactions.

# Approach to Creation

I started with the data because I knew the app would heavily rely on the Account Model. I then decided that the best way to associate transactions with models was to embed them. I then created the models and implemented the route/controller actions to operate on the models. After that, I built the views and added styling.

# Technology used

Mongo, Express, Handlebars, Node, Mongoose, Passport
