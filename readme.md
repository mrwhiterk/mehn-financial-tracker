# Money Moves

This is a application for tracking your expenses, understanding your spending habits, and ultimately how it affects your networth. You will be able to login and securely track your accounts with an interface that's not so precise as to create a security concern(for instance, if the server was to be comprimised). There is no PII request from users. The overall goal of this project was to empower a user to better utilize their income and work towards creating wealth.

## Getting Started
